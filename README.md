# byte-size-projects
A repo for working on small projects with a small group

The idea to start a repo for this came after months of life putting a pause on our business idea. While the plans are on hold, we want to use this space to flesh ideas out that could be safely placed in open-source. This also makes a great portfolio for our work performed outside of our current jobs.
